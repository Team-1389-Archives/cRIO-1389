Attempted to switch to a command-based robot structure, which would let us use SmartDashboard to choose which command runs for autonomous. 

Commands aren't passed motor objects by the main class however, they have to Require a subsystem.

Subsystems get their motors and whatnot from the robot map

However, there is *no* documentation on creating a robot map. This combined with the relative obtuseness of the whole command-based robot system has lead me to abandon this attempted conversion.
